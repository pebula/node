/**
 * Represents a matching between a runtime type (TS reflection) and a mongoose type.
 *
 * The `tsType` is the actual runtime type used by a column.
 * The `type` is an object representing a mongoose column type (i.e. Schema` or `SchemaType`)
 *
 * If the mongoose type is `Schema`, the `type` property will reference it directly.
 * If the mongoose type is `SchemaType` the `type` property will be an object the hold the `SchemaType`.
 *
 * The object that "holds" the `SchemaType` can be `GtSchemaTypeSingleMetadataArgs` or `GtSchemaTypeContainerMetadataArgs`
 * The distinction exists to separate between single item types and collection types (array, map, etc...).
 * In any case, both interfaces contain the `schemaType` property which holds a direct reference to the `SchemaType`.
 * If the referenced `SchemaType` is a container type (e.g. Map, Array) it will also contain 2 additional properties.
 * - `isContainer`: always set to true, used to distinguish between the 2 interfaces at runtime.
 * - `toSchema`: A factory that is used to create the final mongoose type (which always is `SchemaTypeOptions`)
 *
 * For example, a mongoose Map type of dates (`Map<Date>`) is defined as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * {
 *   type: mongoose.Schema.Types.Map,
 *   of: mongoose.schemaType: Schema.Types.Date,
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * This is dynamic so we need the `toSchema` factory, which accepts both type and internal type (`of`)

 * Due to TS limitations, whenever an Array or Map are used, the type that they wrap is unknown which requires the user to explicitly set it.
 * Additionally, due to certain issues with references on startup, the user might set the type through a getter function.
