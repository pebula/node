 * When both `SgServer` and `SgClient` are used you can link the two together to allow sharing of resources.
 * This will allow sharing the connection, including credentials for both underlying client & managements connections.
 *
 * To link `SgServer` and `SgClient`:
 *
 *   - Make sure that the identifiers `SbServerOptions.name` & `SgClientOptions.name` are identical.
 *   - Make sure `SgClientOptions.client` is not set.
 *
 * By default, both identifiers are not set which means that the link is activated unless `SgClientOptions.client` is set.
 *
 * Note that this apply to `SgClientOptions.management` as well.
 *
 * If you wonder why we need to pair via id, see https://github.com/nestjs/nest/issues/4410#issuecomment-603685569.
 * Basically, injection is now available in a microservice `Server` so we can't share resources in a transparent way.
