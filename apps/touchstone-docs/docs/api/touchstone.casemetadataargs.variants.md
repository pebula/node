## CaseMetadataArgs.variants property

A list of variants that will run in the suite, each as a separate case. I.E. run the same method as a new case but with a different benchmark configuration set.

&gt; Note that each variant must have a unique name across the entire suite and must not match the original name or any other variant name for this method and other methods within the Suite.

&gt; Note that filters apply on each variant like it will on any regular case.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
variants?: Array<Required<Omit<CaseMetadataArgs, 'variants'>>>;
```
